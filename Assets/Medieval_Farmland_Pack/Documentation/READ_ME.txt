Medieval Farmland Buildings and Props Documentation :


Thank you very much for buying my package !

Pack Includes :
A demo scene for giving you some examples and ideas on how to place your medieval prefabs in your scene. All the materials and textures used in the makings of the 3d models, so that you can reuse some of the textures or materials into other 3d models you made, and of course, all the prefabs this pack contains.

Good to know :
each building as two version of itself, there is one were all the parts that compose the building are independent objects, that can be enabled or disabled as you want, it is useful for destruction animation or for top down game where the roof needs to be disabled or enabled to see the interior. The second version is where all the objects are merge into one optimized mesh, where all the interior faces inside the model were erased for having one and unique mesh. The models used in the demo scene, where the screenshots and videos were taken, were the one mesh version of the models.
